    <h3>Say's Coding Journey</h3>
  </summary>
 I began my journey into coding at the age of 16, and it felt like stepping into a whole new world. Although I loved it, I didn't initially see coding as a potential career opportunity. As the years passed, my skills improved steadily. Recently, a few months ago, I made a significant decision to change my approach to programming. I created several projects to showcase in my portfolio, with the goal of securing a job in the field.
